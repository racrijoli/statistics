It is known that Test A correctly detects the disease in 95% of cases in which it is present, but it can also give a positive result in 10% of cases in which the person is healthy. Test B, on the other hand, has a 90% accuracy rate for detecting the disease and a 5% false positive rate. If a patient tests positive in both tests, what is the probability that he or she actually has the disease? Consider that the probability of a person developing the disease is 0.1."
