# Statistics

In this repository I will share my assignments and projects from the E.B.A course by Data Scientist Renata Biaggi. Classes cover statistics from basic to advanced concepts. The acronym stands for "Estatística do Básico ao Avançado", in Portuguese, or Basic to Advanced Statistics, in English.

Feedback is always welcome!
